# Project idea: Webscraper

Objective 1 - Create a script that extracts a dataset from a public website
Objective 2 - Produce a visualisation of the cleaned data that we are interested in

Learning Goals:
1) --> Practice handling of raw data
    - What data do we want?
        - Expected data types of raw extracted data
        - Cleaned data types
    - Preprocessing

2) --> Practice programming in a pythonic way; later on, when proficient with fundamentals - find more convenient ways to process.
    -- Refine fundamentals
        - Algorithmic thinking
        - Core fundamentals
            - List / Dict comprehensions

3) --> Practice Test Driven Development and try to integrate it to programming mindset
    -- Try to practice [Try:Except Blocks]
    -- Each step should have a test case outlined beforehand
        - e.g. [Processing large dataset of raw data] -> Process a small sample of 5
        - If output is as desired:
            - Test Pass
        - Else:
            - Test fail

4) --> Practice data presentation skills
    -- [TDD] Test visualisations with small sample from cleaned data
    -- Create functions:
        - Plot dimensions
        - Plot parameters
        - Plot show
        - Plot labels, titles, legend
